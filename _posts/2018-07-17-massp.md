# My Involvement with MaSSP Vietnam


Last winter, I came across a recruitment message for open positions at [Math and Science Summer Program (MaSSP)](https://www.masspvn.com/). I have always wanted to be involved in something that gives back to Vietnam and help younger students, so I did not hesitate to apply for a logistics position.

Not long after, I received an email explaining why it was necessary that this position would require a candidate to be in Vietnam, and encouraging me to apply to be a headmentor for the Data Science subject. I never thought I was qualified for this position to apply, but I challenged myself and put together a proposal to apply anyway.

At the time, I recently ventured into Data Science and Machine Learning from a project that I did at school, so I gathered everything I knew about ML to make that proposal. Though I couldn't go to Vietnam for the camp this year, I still decided to stay with the program and help out, and it was one of the best decision I have ever made. Let me explain why:

__1. Management__

As the headmentor of Data Science, I helped chị Châu - the Academic Advisor of MaSSP, recruited other mentors for Data Science by writing up a job descriptions, scheduling and interviewing candidates.

Since we have the final list of DS mentors, we started to have weekly meeting to update each other on the progress of MaSSP as well as our lessons planned. After MaSSP closed the applications for high school students, we also divided questions to selected students as well.

Throughout the preparation and the duration of the program, I learned so much about managing tasks, helping everyone on the DS team, and making sure everyone is on the same page and enjoy their summer. This experience
