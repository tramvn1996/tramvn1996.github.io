## My Life outside of Mastercard


While it’s not as techie as Silicone Valley, or glamorous as NYC, I still tried to make the most out of my summer here and be a sponge. Needless to say, there is a lot to learn and tons of things to do (that I may not be able to do elsewhere)

__1. Fourth of July at the Arch__


It was not the same as being in Washington DC, listen to their live concert, and watch the firework, but I still got to see the St. Louis fair, watched a [Boeing Air show](https://www.fairsaintlouis.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Boeing-Air-Show-Performers-1.pdf) , listened to the famous [St. Louis Symphony orchestra](https://www.slso.org/), and enjoyed the fireworks 10 miles from where they fired them. And I get to do all of this for FREE? Who doesn’t love freebies? Well, we did have to pay for the MetroLink and a Lyft home, but we all had fun, which was what mattered the most.


__2. Cardinal Game__


Nothing is more fun than going to a game where your home team won an overwhelming victory and Mastercard, where I am interning, paid for us to be in the luxury suite. We were unfortunate that the game was on a rainy day, so the game was delayed for 2 hours, but luckily, it was not canceled.

It was my first time going to a Cardinal game, and it was amazing! I love the energy in the field, especially when the Cardinals scored themselves a good homerun. One of the factors that I thought made us enjoy the game so much was the seating. I watched a Nationals game 2 years ago, but my seat was too far for me to see anything, so it was not fun. Therefore, maybe in the future, if I am to take anyone to a baseball game, I will make sure to secure really good seats early on

__3. Zoo (No. 1 Zoo in the US, and it’s free)__

St. Louis is known about its no.1 zoo in the United States, and they took pride on it, so it is a must to check out! I was excited to see the little penguins since I didn't get to see them the last time I visited. Other than the cute penguins chilling, all the other animals are pretty tired. Maybe it's close to their dinner time :'(

We went on a Saturday afternoon, and the tricky part is that the zoo closes at 7:30pm, but it was still boiling hot outside until 6pm. While we had fun and everything at the zoo, I would recommend others to go in the morning, or the best time of the year to go would be in spring season.


__4. Imagine Dragon Concert__

I spent $65 on a lawn ticket to see Imagine Dragon in July. I have to say my money was well spent. The only regret I had that night was that “why didn’t I spend an extra $30-$40 to sit closer to Imagine Dragon”. However, it probably the best I have ever made, since I also got to see Grace Vanderwalt for the opening. Her singing live was amazing, and I loved all of her new songs.

Then we got to listen to all of Imagine Dragons biggest hits, and let me tell you, they were great live. I thought their songs were already good on Youtube, turn out, I did not know anything. I would totally spend my money to see them again and again and again, because I love them that much.


Though outside was hot and humid, the concert did not begin until 7pm, and Imagine Dragons started to sing around 8:30pm, so no need to worry about hot weather.


__5. Forest Park__


Ok, let’s be real, I only passed by the park briefly when I came to the zoo, but this is on the list of the places I wanted to visit in St. Louis :D
