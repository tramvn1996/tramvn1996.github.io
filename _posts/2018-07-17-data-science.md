## "How I learned about Data Science, Big Data,..."

Despite the hype of “Data Science is the Sexiest Job”, I love it more because of the interdisciplinary nature of it, and I believe Data Science can be among the technologies that help people better understand and allow us to better assist one another. Here is some resources that I use to hone my skills:

1. Take classes even though they are not required for my major
While many colleges and universities started to offer Data Science program, Stetson University is too small to accommodate that demand. On the bright side, there are many classes that I can take that would be extremely helpful for me to learn more about Data Science. Some of them are more in the Math domain such as: Linear Algebra, Math Modeling and Simulation, Probability, … While some focus more on the Computer Science, for example: Big Data Mining and Analytics, Discrete Structures, …

I started college with a major in Economics, so as I took Economics classes, I realized classes that were helpful for me to get started to data work were Econometrics. This class also covers some statistics methods such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Dynamic Model,... In addition, we also got to learn about different ways to diagnose a model, which is tremendously important when it comes to evaluating your work.

As an econ major, I probably did not need to take that many of Math and CS classes, but I chose to, and I got a lot out of them.

2. Learn from online sources
I wish we can just work hard in school and that would be enough to succeed in life. Well, that is not exactly the case now anymore. I am inspired by my friends around me to continue my learning outside of the classroom.

I took my baby steps by trying to use R or Python to run my econometric model
