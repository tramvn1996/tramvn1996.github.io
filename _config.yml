    sub_header: "   I'm currently a senior majoring in Mathematics and Economics at Stetson University, Florida. Growing up in Vietnam, a developing country, I did not know that 'coding' can be a career, let alone 'data science'. What is data science btw?
    \n \n I recently discovered my love for data, or a combination of economics and math with a touch of computer science. With the experience working at companies such as Facebook or Mastercard, I learned that data science is more an art than a science, and my dream is to be able to use this knowledge to create tools and technologies to help people everywhere.
