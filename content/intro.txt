My name is Tram, I will turn 22 this September. I was born and raised in Vietnam, then first went to the US to participate in an exchange program where I was chosen by a lovely family in Iowa. After that, I decided to enroll in college at Stetson University, Florida. So many things have changed since the day I started school at Stetson.

I started out studying Economics, as my "safe choice", but Economics has given me more than what I had expected. Coming from Vietnam, a developing country, I envisioned people in the US would live a wealthy and abundant lives. While some of them do live these lives, some suffer heavily from lacking resources. I realized I was, indeed, previldged.
